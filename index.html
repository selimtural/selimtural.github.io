 <h1>Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA)</h1>
 <p>A=(Q, Σ, S, δ, F)<br>
Σ= is the alphabet (of the input symbols)<br>
Q=is a finite set of states.<br>
δ= s the transition function where δ: Q x Σ -> Q<br>

 
S ε Q -> Start states (it s must one states)<br>
F ⊆ Q -> Final states (it s mustn’t one states)<br>
 a regular language can represent more than one dfa, while each dfa can represent only one regular language. In the same sense, every nfa is not a dfa, even though every dfa is a nfa at the same time<br>
 the start states is indicated by a star.<br>
the states are shown in a circle.<br>
The states is indicated by the transition arrows.<br>
the end states is enclosed in double round.<br>
 The starting point can only be one and two state departures from a state can not be defined.<br>
